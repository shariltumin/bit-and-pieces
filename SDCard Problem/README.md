We have problems with machine.SDCard() with the newer version of MicroPython firmwares, see https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/16125

Three files are provided here for debugging and possible solutions:
1. vfs_blockdev.c
2. esp32_SDcard5.py
3. esp32_SDcard5.log

Replace the micropython/extmod/vfs_blockdev.c with the one provided and recompile.
